      </div>
      <div class="p">
        <p>
          The Food Waste Index Report 2024 introduces
a “Solutions Focus” chapter that spotlights
approaches that can deliver food waste
reductions at scale. The first solution in this
series explores public-private partnerships
(PPPs). As food waste is an issue
throughout the entire supply chain, PPPs
bring stakeholders together to collaborate
and deliver a shared goal, thus overcoming
some of the challenges of a fragmented
food system. PPPs connect businesses
with government and policy makers in a precompetitive space, allowing best practice to be
shared while driving innovation for long-term,
holistic change

        </p>
        Food waste PPPs require signatories to
measure and report their food waste for
monitoring purposes, which provides important
data that can be used to demonstrate
the business case to invest in food waste
reduction. PPPs are typically designed at
the country level, but in very large countries
they can be subregional (for example, the
Pacific Coast Food Waste Commitment).
Sector-specific industry agreements at the
regional level also can play a role, such as the
International Food Waste Coalition focusing on
food waste in the hospitality sector
        <p>
          PPPs have a proven track record of delivering
food waste reductions. The Courtauld
Commitment in the United Kingdom was
initiated in 2005, and the current phase,
Courtauld Commitment 2030, aims to
deliver farm-to-fork reductions in food waste,
greenhouse gas emissions and water stress
through collaborative action across the
entire UK food chain. Actions have resulted
in a 27 per cent reduction in household food
waste per capita and a 23 per cent reduction
in total food waste per capita between 2007
and 2018 . Cost-benefit
analysis of the Courtauld Commitment 2015–
2018, including government spending and
operational costs, suggests that there is a 7:1
benefit-to-cost ratio.

          By working together to achieve collective goals, organizations from across the food and drink sector can learn from each
other, collaborate, and deliver change in the most efficient and effective way (REFRESH 2021). The PPP model, done well,
has a number of qualities that enable and drive collaborative impact, displayed in Figure.

        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>Private sector</h5>
          From inception, PPPs are shaped by the signatories, through agreeing on collective
          targets. PPPs should then evolve as the signatory base grows. Successful PPPs
          enlist organizations throughout the supply chain including manufacturers, retailers,
          wholesalers, food service organizations, waste management companies, trade bodies,
          agricultural businesses and farmers. In addition to ensuring that members span the
          food supply chain, recruitment should be carefully planned and strategic. Recruiting
          high-profile organizations can build confidence in the agreement and attract additional
          members.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>Private sector</h5>
          PPPs also require government collaboration and support. How governments can
          engage with PPPs can be multifaceted but can include providing an evidence base to
          support the creation of a PPP, bringing organizations together to build and maintain a
          PPP and by providing funding support. In regard to funding, research has suggested
          that PPPs with financial support from governments as well as private members are
          more likely to be stable and effective, as PPPs that are solely privately funded are at
          risk of being designed to accommodate the priorities of the largest funders (Pitas et al.
          2018). Aligning the objectives of a PPP with government policy can also lead to quicker
          implementation and greater impact (REFRESH 2021).

      </div>
      <div class="p2">
        <p>
          This section focuses on the number of countries with measured datapoints. In
countries with more than one datapoint for the same sector, where there is no obvious
reason to prefer one to another (such as methodological robustness or geographic
coverage), the average of multiple datapoints is taken.
Table presents the number of estimates for all sectors based on countries’ World
Bank income groupings. As in the Food Waste Index Report 2021, in all sectors the
majority of datapoints are from high income countries. The growth in countries with
datapoints in 2024 is driven in large part by the European Commission’s data reporting
exercise, which covered all EU-27 countries, some of which did not have estimates
in the Food Waste Index Report 2021. The high income category is also the largest
income grouping, so it would be expected that more countries have data there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same data is presented according to regional distribution in Table 9.10 There
remain uneven distributions of data between regions, but this shows – for the
household sector at least – substantial growth of identified datapoints in multiple
regions. Notably, some regions with very small numbers of datapoints – or none at all
– in the Food Waste Index Report 2021 now have many more countries represented.
In particular, Northern Africa, Melanesia and Micronesia all now have identifiable
estimates, which are beneficial for improving the regional extrapolations. The addition
of some datapoints from small island states improves the understanding of household
food waste in different food environments. Only Central Asia and Polynesia remain as
subregions without any estimates
        </p>
        <p>
          The regional distribution remains very uneven in the non-household sectors, with
many lacking usable data. This is not to suggest that no work is being undertaken in
these sectors and countries; in many cases, measurements have taken place for some
subsectors (such as hotels or restaurants) but are lacking the disaggregation or scaling
required to form a nationally representative estimate. This is discussed further in Box
        </p>
        <p>

    </div>
    <div class="main4">
      <div class="sus"></div>
      <div class="p3">
        <p>
          As a result of these differences in the availability of data, many uncertainties remain
          about food waste generation in these sectors. This is particularly the case in low
          income countries and for the food service and retail sectors in all middle-income and
          low-income countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the proportion of countries with some food waste estimates is relatively low, the
estimates found are generally concentrated in more populous countries. In households,
for example, coverage by country is less than 50 per cent, but the population of
countries with at least some household data covers 85 per cent of the global
population (Table 10). Even if smaller countries with more limited resources are not
able to directly measure their own food waste, the understanding of global food waste
will benefit from direct measurement and reporting in the world’s largest countries.
The G20 countries, as the largest economies and representing around two-thirds of the
global population, have a particular role to play in advancing food waste measurement
and action

      </div>
      <div class="p4">
        <p>
          Sustainable food represents a comprehensive approach to the
          production, distribution, and consumption of food that goes beyond the
          mere act of nourishment. It is a philosophy and a set of practices
          that seeks to harmonize the diverse elements of our global food system
          to achieve multiple positive outcomes for the environment, society,
          and individual well-being. At the heart of sustainable food lies a
          deep commitment to environmental stewardship. This approach recognizes
          that the Earth's resources are finite, and the ecosystems that support
          food production must be conserved and protected. As such, sustainable
          food production is characterized by practices that minimize negative
          environmental impacts. This includes the reduction of greenhouse gas
          emissions, the preservation of biodiversity, and the protection of
          natural resources such as clean water and fertile soils. Organic
          farming, agroecological practices, and reduced pesticide use are all
          facets of sustainable food production that work in harmony with the
          environment, rather than depleting it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Food waste is another key issue addressed by sustainable food systems.
          The wasteful disposal of food contributes to resource depletion and
          environmental degradation. Sustainable food encourages reduced waste
          through strategies such as composting, recycling, and responsible
          consumer choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, the goal of sustainable food is to ensure equitable access
          to nutritious and safe food for all. This means addressing issues of
          food insecurity and food deserts, where individuals and communities
          lack access to affordable, healthy food. Sustainable food systems aim
          to create a more just and equitable food system where everyone has the
          opportunity to access the nourishment they need. In summary,
          sustainable food is a multifaceted approach that transcends the
          traditional boundaries of food production, focusing on the well-being
          of the planet, the livelihoods of those who produce our food, and the
          health and nutrition of those who consume it. It seeks to balance
          ecological responsibility with ethical treatment of labor and animals,
          support local economies, reduce waste, and foster equitable access to
          nourishing food.
